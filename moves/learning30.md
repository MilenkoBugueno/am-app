# Learning 3.0
As MilenkoBugueno I want to use learning 3.0 in order to learn to code an app

## Move#1: Memorize all learning 3.0 values by means of flash cards

 *I believe that:* memorizing the learning 3.0 values
 
 *Will result in:* a better understanding of learning 3.0
 
 *I'll know that the move works when:* I know by heart all eight values

 1. Learn in the real world
 2. Delve only into what is in front of you
 3. Be the protagonist of your learning
 4. Share it! This is the best way to learn
 5. Optimise your learning networks
 6. Ideas are as important as experiences
 7. Visualising the learning is better than measuring it
 8. Learn in harmony with your brain
